To protect your account, we strongly recommend that you bind your account.\n\nBinding your account enables you to retrieve your Base if you play the game on another device or if you lose your game data.\n\nYou can bind your account by clicking your Avatar (at the top left corner) and going to - Settings - Account.\n\nⅡ. To protect your account security, don't allow others to easily log in to your account.\n\nThe game account will automatically be bound to the device on which it's played. If other people log in to your account once, they can log into your account in the future as well.\n\nThe following circumstances may lead others to be able to log into your account.\n\n1. If you buy someone's account, the seller can still access their game even if it is not bound to the seller's social platform account (such as Facebook). They can log in at any time even after you buy it from them.\n\n2. Other players who you allow to make purchases for you can log into your account at any time. This will lead to account security problems.\n\n3. If you let an Alliance member log into your account, even with your permission, they can still log in on their own device at a later time.\n\nIf any of these three circumstances occur, you cannot stop the other party from logging into your account even if you change your account password or bind to a new social platform account.\n\nProtect your game account! Please say no to those dangerous behaviors so as to avoid unnecessary loss!

200156=No one knows Crazy Raven's real name or where she comes from. Everyone who meets her thinks she is a maniac. She never went to school - all of her knowledge came from reading books while growing up in an orphanage. People who know her compare to her to a young Einstein. Her research results, had they been properly appreciated, would have been enough to win a Nobel Prize. \n When she was just 16 years old, she took her first Z Virus sample to the Institute of Biochemistry. The researchers all thought it was crazy, and refused to test her sample. \n At 22, Raven was invited to the World Health Organization for research where she successfully developed the Z-Virus Type 1 Strain. Because of the inability to predict the experimental results, human experimentation was rejected. \n By age 27, she was approached by the Z organization which was more . . . open to experiments on humans. There, Raven successfully created the frightening killing machine codenamed Giant, and in the same year created the powerful Avenger. \n No one knows how the Z-Virus originated. Some speculated that Raven tried to spread the virus in revenge for being rejected by the Institute. Others believe that virus samples were bought or stolen and released. The actual truth is unknown.
200157=This is the story of a lucky little girl. The littler girl was born in a poor area of the Philippines. With no known relatives and no name, she miraculously survived in garbage heaps and sewers. She did not receive any education and until the age of 2 could not say a word. Long-term malnutrition caused her to be small and skinny, but her mind grew strong. \n When the Z virus broke out, the girl was 14 years old. The extremely fast spread of the virus turned her home into a human hell, where wandering zombies could kill her at any time. During that time, a well known Filipino warlord and his troops came through the town and rescued her. The warlord gave her a name, Maggie Augustine, and cared for her as if she were his own daughter. \n For someone who never felt any affection, the warlord's favor was her only light in the world and the spiritual pillar of her survival. Since she entered the warlord's cold cement base, she became a member of the warlord's youth scouts. Every day she endured inhuman training and torture. \n Growing up as a scavenger, Maggie had no problem with such a life and was very obedient. After 10 years of training, she became an excellent soldier in the army and repeatedly accomplished tasks given to her by the warlord. \n Anarchy is Maggie's routine, and she shows cold-blooded ruthlessness. She only shows her childish side to the warlord, but to the enemy her face is as horrible as death. \n At age 25, the warlord promoted her to Mercenary Captain. She destroyed her enemies in many private wars and missions, and became a famous mercenary leader.

Al Sharif now works for the Z-Organization Al Sharif was attracted by the lure of the mysterious ancient treasures said to be buried in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. While searching for the treasure, Al Sharif’s tribe and family were attacked and killed by reanimated mummies. \n He was found in the ruins of the Desert Oasis by Z Organization members. Al Sharif’s body was shaking violently, and he was shouting loudly in an obscure version of ancient Arabic. In his hands were a rare golden dagger and a mysterious golden key. \n Z Organization medical staff took him to an Oasis Hospital for emergency treatment. After recovering, Al Sharif became a desert specialist for the Z-Organization archaeological team, helping Z Organization members search for Ancient Keys and mysterious Pharaoh’s Chests. His only goal, however, is seeking revenge for his family and tribe.
200159=Cecilia Chou was born in China. Her father was a famous race car driver and her mother was part of an American financial dynasty. Cecilia grew up in China’s Fujian province until the age of 12, when she moved to the US with her mother. \n As a child, Cecilia loved cars. Her room was filled with model cars and she would talk cars with the boys from her neighborhood. Cecilia’s father taught her all he knew about both driving and the engineering of cars. After graduating college, Cecilia opened up a car modification shop with the support of her family and friends. \n When the Zombie Virus outbreak occurred, Cecilia and her friends volunteered to join the global rescue effort. She was awarded medals by the Red Cross for driving supply trucks to hard-hit areas and for transporting medical equipment for front line troops.\n Cecilia realized that she could contribute more to helping people. Introduced to the famous Dr. John Stark, she joined the Z Organization and was made responsible for modifying vehicles for zombie battle and transportation. \n After joining the Z Organization, Cecilia noticed that she and another Hero in the same department – Samantha Chou - wore an identical jade necklace with the name “Chou” written on it. After hearing her story and doing some investigating, the two discovered that Samantha was actually Cecilia’s long-lost cousin! \n Since then, Cecilia and Samantha served together in the Z Organization Vehicle Department. Cecilia was quickly promoted due to her amazing talent and knowledge of vehicles. She personally designed and built the prototype of the “Road Tyrant” Vehicle Unit.

200161=Louis Bernard was born to an ordinary family in Marseille, France. As a student he excelled in sports, but his adventurous and energetic nature often brought him into conflict with his teachers. Both his adventuring and the conflicts only increased as he got older. \n Although he seemed to be a reckless athlete, Louis loved reading military history books and building model airplanes. At the age of 20, he was accepted to the French “Ecole l’Air” Air Force Military College.\n His military school training gave Louis not only a rock-hard body but an iron will. These two factors became the signature of his post-graduation military career. Louis’s thirst for action and adventure, however, could sometimes border on recklessness. \n After the Zombie Virus outbreak, Louis was recommended to the Z Organization. He was promoted to the rank of Colonel and appointed to lead the Z Organization Air Forces. \n Since then, Louis has led the Z Organization Helicopter Forces to rescue countless survivors from around the world. During the Battle of Paris, Louis’s helicopter crash landed as he personally led his forces to rescue survivors. Wounded, exhausted and out of ammunition, Louis managed to kill 19 Zombies with only his military knife and improvised weapons. For his bravery, he’s been called the “Defender of Paris” but in the Z Organization he is known as their “Protecting Hand.”
200162=Helena Skotnicka was born in Warsaw, Poland to a businessman father and housewife mother. \n At the age of 7, Helena was infected by a serious viral illness, and was in and out of critical condition at the local hospital. The illness affected her eyes, leaving her almost blind. After several months of fighting the disease, Helena miraculously recovered. Her eyes had somehow been mutated by the virus, resulting in dramatic changes. Her eyesight was greatly improved, allowing her to see clearly up to 1 kilometer away. Helena also had superhuman night vision, allowing her to see several hundred meters away in dark conditions. These vision abilities were noticed by the local military, and Helena entered military schools for training. \n Helena was involved in several major military campaigns, demonstrating amazing sharpshooting abilities. In the Mediterranean campaign, she recorded a documented 3,052 meter sniper rifle shot – a new world record. \n Helena specialized in long range firearms for many years, and at age 27 she along with her team designed the HS-327 sniper rifle with an effective range of up to 6,100M. \n 3 years before the outbreak of the Zombie Virus, Helena and her team met the future leaders of the Z Organization. After the Zombie Virus outbreak, she became one of the 13 founders of the Z Organization. Later, the Z Organization Reconnaissance Unit was named after her: “Eagle Eye.”

200644=Born in a rugby family in England, influenced by his family since childhood, a huge fan of sports, owning an excellent physique beyond ordinary people.

Because of keeping company with Zombies all day long, people began to forget his name, and call him only Alien.
200645=Raymond was born in a rugby player family, in Manchester, England. His father was the coach of local team, and his mother was the team doctor. Influenced by his family, Raymond had been exercising since childhood, and his physical quality was much better than his peers. \n  However, because of the Zombie Virus outbreak, everything has changed. \n  Thanks to their excellent physical quality and tenacious will, the Raymonds had been holding out in a Defensive Cover, but were finally breached by the tireless Zombies, and that was the reason why Raymond was separated from his parents who were managing to protect him. Raymond nearly came to a breakdown when he escaped to the safe zone. \n  Firmly believed that his parents were still alive, Raymond set foot on the dangerous road to search for his family regardless of the discouragement of residents in town. \n  However, the Goddess of Luck did not appear, when saving the 13th Survivor, the wounded who was actually infected suddenly became mad and bit Raymond's right arm. \n  Raymond was infected. \n  Raymond ran away from the crowd by controlling his gradually rigid body, became unconscious inside the City with corpses lying on the ground, and waited for the death alone. \n  Not knowing how long, Raymond became awake, thinking of being in the hell, and realized he could still smell the rotten stink of Zombies in the air. Wanting to reach out and rub his eyes, he found a mutation occurred in the right arm, and this change was spreading all over the body at a perceptible speed. Raymond was a lucky dog. This mutation has surprisingly reinforced his physique. Because of this, Raymond could set foot on the road to search for his relatives again, even at this moment, his appearance was no longer the same as a normal human. \n  Raymond still remembers the terror of gaze from the first human who saw him after his rebirth, and his trembling arm when pulling the gun and pulling the trigger. It was not until people saw Raymond saving one after another human being from Zombies, did they begin to accept Raymond. \n  Raymond's deeds have been spread, and the Z Organization found him, which has discovered his ability to control Zombies caused by the mutation. \n  Raymond, who has become more and more weird, joined in the Z Organization to look for his parents, and did not mind saving some people without difficulty.

79011205=Johnny Z Smith was born into a Catholic family and was brought up in a strict religious household from an early age. As an adolescent, he rebelled against his strict upbringing and joined a group of tough kids. Although he didn't engage in violence, his lifestyle was extremely upsetting to his family. Prior to age 24, his life revolved around alcohol, drugs and women. \n After the Zombie virus outbreak, the world was plunged into chaos. Governments shut down and anarchy reigned in the streets. Fear for his family finally led Johnny to change his ways. In order to protect his little sister, he had to arm himself with weapons and fight zombies and gangs to survive. \n While learning how to fight in the streets, Johnny and his sister barely managed to survive. Realizing that they could not survive like that forever, Johnny began to look for a group that could protect his sister. He journeyed through the streets, searching for trustworthy allies. Eventually, Johnny formed a team of strong men and women that could survive the zombie outbreak. This team, called Salvation, embodies the WarZ spirit.

79011234=Born in Ireland to an ordinary fishing family, Shawn fished at sea with his parents since childhood and became proficient with fishing gear and harpoons. At 25, he was married to his childhood sweetheart and had a young daughter. Life wasn't easy, but it was happy. \n    After the zombie outbreak, fishing was affected as wide scale dumping of waste, bodies and dead zombies into the ocean took place. After a particularly bad zombie dump, Shawn and his family were infected by eating tainted fish. His frail wife didn't survive long, leaving Shawn to journey with his young daughter for help. Shawn and his daughter survived for months - something never before seen by those infected - but were turned away from settlement after settlement because they showed signs of infection. After being chased from yet another survivor base, Shawn and his daughter were attacked by wild zombies and his daughter was carried away. Shawn collapsed in despair as his body finally started to succumb to the long infection from the zombie virus. \n    When Shawn woke up, he found that he had been rescued by the LastShelter Organization. They were able to stop the progression of the virus, but could not remove it from his body. Shawn was not a zombie, but not fully human either. \n LastShelter joined the Z Organization, and the zombie virus infection made him extremely powerful on the battlefield. Later, he became famous as the powerful "Zombie Hunter."
79011235=Vernon Lightman was born into a traditional American family. His parents ran a family business. During childhood, Vernon showed astonishing mathematical talent. After graduating from college, Vernon did not continue his studies. Instead, he borrowed $15,000 from his parents to start trading futures investments and began his difficult business journey. \n Over the next 20 years, Vernon founded companies in 12 different industries, suffered 9 bankruptcies and 2 complete business failures. Finally, in the golden age of economic development Vernon had enduring success with 23 global Vernon Mall department stores. \n Vernon expanded his business empire into import and export, food processing, oil and heavy industry, and now controls the world's number one business empire. He is also one of the 10 richest people in the world. Vernon was known for buying unpopular real estate and turning it around to earn huge profits. Because of his ability to turn waste into treasure, he is nicknamed the Golden Hand.
79011237=Before she became an expert driver, Samantha was abandoned as a baby and found and adopted by Cecil, the Vehicle Master. Cecil had no children of his own, so he gave Samantha all of his love and affection. Cecil attempted to give Samantha a typical British upbringing, but Samantha gradually became more and more rebellious as she grew older. She formed a gang of drivers with her friends, and were often involved in illegal street racing and other activities. \n Since childhood, Cecil taught Samantha how to build, upgrade and race many types of vehicles. A natural driver, Samantha was known as the Street Legend. \n When the zombie outbreak happened, Samantha almost lost Cecil - her only family member. Cecil only survived with the help of the Z Organization. \n Samantha joined the Z organization, and became the leader of their Vehicle forces. She had to learn to be calm and collected early, but recurring nightmares of zombies and crashes make her stoic and cold. Only when she's with Cecil will Samantha show a little smile.
79011238=William Hoffman was born into a farming family in Northern Ireland. The son of a well known local farmer, he worked on several dairy farms. William worked on the farm more than he went to school, and he was satisfied with helping providing for his family. At the age of 18, he was called into the army and began a 12 year army career. As a 30 year old veteran, he returned home and married his childhood sweetheart. \n William was 50 with a married son when the zombie outbreak happened. A large scale zombie attack hit his town, and his once happy family was destroyed in the blink of an eye. His family was killed, and as his house collapsed William was crushed by a falling beam. A local Z organization unit rescued him from the ruins, but William's spine was crushed in the collapse and he was left paralyzed from the waist down. \n His paralyzed body could not stop William's anger and desire for revenge against the zombies. With his new combat machine Zombie Shredder, William stands once more against the zombies. He eagerly joined the Z Organization and, ignoring all danger, throws himself into battle against the zombies wherever possible.
79011239=As an offspring of a legendary ninja clan, Okita Kazuya led a life of luxury and great wealth. Although he enjoyed his ninja training and was a gifted student, he had no interest in his family's secret and illegal businesses. He preferred to live a playboy lifestyle and ignored the ninja traditions. When the zombie virus appeared in Japan, Okita joined the Z Organization due to its effectiveness on the ground. During a battle with zombies, Okita was severely injured and was close to death. \n The Z Organization rushed Okita into surgery, and his life was saved by the famous Dr. John Stark. Due to his ninja skills, this global peacekeeping organization believed that Okita could play an important role in the battle against the zombies. Because of his serious injuries, however, Okita could not fight at anywhere near the level he once was able to. The Z Organization agreed to rebuild his body using experimental technology, but only if Okita agreed to commit himself to the Z Organization and fight at their command. After a series of surgeries to enhance his body with robotic technology, Okita became even faster and more agile than before and raised his ninja skills to a superhuman level. After being turned into a living weapon Okita ruthlessly goes about his mission to remove all zombies from the world.
79011240=Daisy was a hard working information analyst within a major intelligence agency. She worked deep in a secret basement of the agency headquarters performing back office work to support her partner in performing dangerous secret missions. On a major mission, she received bad intel from her partner which not only caused the mission to fail, but led to the disclosure of several of the agencies top spy assets. With no one else to turn to, Daisy was forced to go into the field for the first time. Working alone, Daisy was able to infiltrate a network of dangerous international arms dealers, thwart their plans and resolve the intelligence crisis. When the zombie outbreak occurred, Daisy knew her role was back in the field infiltrating the enemy and gaining intelligence. Only the most heroic Commanders can gain the trust and services of this Deadly Flower.
79011241=Hunter is a former Navy SEAL Sniper. An exceptional sniper, he had 89 confirmed kills on the battlefield and won a Silver Star for his actions. While fighting against the enemy, Hunter was also fighting against jealousy amongst his own comrades. After stopping a massacre during a battle, Hunter was framed for killing civilians. He was discharged from his unit, and his medals were taken away. Once a hero, he was now a stain on his unit. At his lowest point, he was nearly lost. Then the zombie outbreak occurred, and he was called into service again. He seeks a noble and righteous Commander so that he can rediscover his dignity and become a hero again.
79011242=Always with a cigar in his mouth, and never with a smile on his face, Instructor Schmidt is the Bundeswehr's most fearsome trainer.

Ignoring orders, Schmidt bravely rushed forward and launched a fierce attack on the enemy. His actions inspired his unit, and they attacked and defeated their enemies. Schmidt remained in the army as an instructor until the zombie outbreak occurred. Since then, he has been searching for a brave Commander who can make use of his Devil Training to train the most powerful fighting force.

79011291=Ali was born into a poor family in the slums of Cairo. When he was young, his parents died during a disease outbreak. Since childhood, he and a group of other children in the same situation became scavengers for a living. Unlike many of his peers, he developed an interest in electronics and chemicals. \n When he was 14 years old, he developed a homemade bomb which he used to blow up a safe to steal money to eat. He was caught by police in the store, but a local army Hero took notice of his case and made an exception to get him out of prison. He could enter military training if he stayed out of trouble. \n After years of study and training, Ali became an outstanding soldier. At the age of 19, he took part in the famous First Counterattack Against the Zombies during the initial period of the zombie outbreak. Ali has developed various kinds of mines, firebombs, grenades and other weapons that are widely used both in war and in defense against zombies. He is worthy of the nickname King of Blasting.
79011292=Natasha was born in Russia to a prominent wealthy family. Her father was one of the largest arms dealers in the world. As an only child, she enjoyed the generosity of her father and could only be described as having been born with a silver spoon in her mouth. \n Since childhood, Natasha was showered with endless love and gifts which turned her into a spoiled and unruly child. \n Her father was frequently away on business and her home lacked discipline. When her father returned from a long trip and saw how uncontrollable his daughter had become, he forced her to enter Russia's most famous military academy. She had to complete military school or he would disown her and revoke her inheritance. \n Natasha was initially bored and angry at military school, but there she met an important mentor - a veteran of the KGB Intelligence Service. After 5 years of his training, Natasha became an international agent with skills to rival her mentor's. \n After the zombie outbreak, Natasha joined the Z Organization with her father's support. She became the Z Organization's intelligence chief. Because her father generously supplies arms to the Z Org, her influence is already large and growing every year.
79011293=Always a tough guy, Zane would get into fights and had brushes with the law as a teenager. As an adult, his older brother helped him settle down and get a stable job in construction. He was also president of the local gun club. \n When the outbreak happened, Zane was recruited to defend the local military base. While defending against a zombie attack, Zane’s brother was captured by human bandits. With the help of his new friend and ally Riley, Zane fought his way into the bandit camp, defeated their leader and rescued his brother. But by the time he returned to his home down, zombies had overrun its defenses and most of the inhabitants had fled or had been killed. Realizing they were too few to defend their town, Zane struck out with Riley and a small band of inhabitants to look for a larger group to join. \n He became famous for using his construction experience to rebuild and repair damaged settlements wherever he went. Quiet, but idealistic, Zane refused to leave even 1 person behind and rushed into battle with no regard for his personal safety. He was quickly recruited into the Z Organization. He gained the name “Tip of the Spear” by leading the Z Organization Vanguard when attacking Zombies or bandits alike.

80000460=Letter from Dr. O'Connell:
80000461=Hello, Dear Commander:\n\n  The Desert Oasis is a deserted wasteland, but it contains large amounts of resources. My team and I investigated for several months and found rare resources, but also found ferocious Mummies! Our investigation has become an exciting adventure, and my team and I welcome you to come to the Desert Oasis with us. Find the treasures of the Ancient Pharaoh and uncover the mystery of the Desert Oasis.\n\n  Now, I will share with you some of the information we collected. I believe this will be of great help to you!\n\n  1. Pharaoh's Mint: We found many of these gold coins in the tombs of Pharaohs. They were sealed and kept in perfect condition, and have a very high archaeological value.\n\n  2. Building Plans: We found there were military units here in the past, but we do not know why. Many ruins were discovered, but we did not find any soldiers or even any corpses. Many of the ruins in the desert contain buildings and plans designed specifically for the desert environment. I've attached some plans to this letter. You can try to build them in your Base.\n\n  3. Ancient Keys and Ancient Chests: We found many Ancient Keys that can unlock Pharaoh's Chests containing valuable items. You can also use these keys in the local market to obtain essential supplies.\n\n  4. Mummies: The desert is full of zombies covered with thick strips of bandages. Although they are very dangerous, I do not see how they are different from the zombies that we have encountered before.\n\n  Well, these are our findings from the last few months. I hope that you can adapt to the environment here as soon as possible. In the desert, the weather is our biggest enemy. Make good use of the resources you find and construct some important desert buildings.\n\n  I wish you well\n\n  Brandon O'Connell
80000462=Brief Introduction to the Desert Temporary Military Zone
80000463=Commander:\n\n  We received the drawings from Dr. O'Connell and carefully analyzed the building designs. The buildings are well suited for the harsh desert environment. They will protect our forces during combat operations in the desert. Here is a brief introduction about these buildings:\n\n  1. Transport Troops Camp: Rest camp for transport troops. Constructing this building can greatly increase gathering speed.\n\n  2. Gold Coin Mint: This factory produces imitation Pharaoh's Gold Coins. Build this building to regularly produce Pharaoh's Gold Coins, which are a very rare resource.\n\n  3. Archaeological Camp: Rest camp for the archaeological team. Build this building to increase your chances of finding buried treasure during the collection process.\n\n  4. Desert Combat Base: Deployment and mobilization site for the Desert Conflict. Build this building to significantly enhance troop Siege Attack, Siege Defense and other properties.\n\n  5. Desert Transport Platform: Designed to support armies marching in the thick dust and sand of the Desert Oasis. Build this building to significantly increase Marching Speed, Single Army Max and other properties.\n\n  6. Desert Fortress: Maximum protection for your City's soldiers in the desert. Build this building to significantly enhance Defender Attack, Defender Defense and other properties.\n\n  7. Oasis Hospital: An important medical and logistics center in the Desert Oasis. Build this building to significantly increase Max Wounded, Wounded Recovery Speed and other properties.\n\n  Due to the harsh desert climate, we cannot take the buildings outside of the Walls with us to the Desert Oasis. We were able to build a Desert Garrison and Oasis Resource Warehouse.\n\n  The Desert Garrison consists of shelters and first-aid tents. It is a temporary garrison for the Desert Oasis where wounded soldiers can be treated.\n\n  The Oasis Resource Warehouse stores resources from your original State. You can receive resources here regularly (using the same method as Farms, Oil Wells etc. from the original State).\n\n  >>>You can spend some Pharaoh's Gold Coins on the open space outside of your Walls, but I must remind you that these buildings will be demolished at the end of the Desert Expedition. You will not be able to move them back to your original State.<<<\n\n  --From your Construction Team

83400075=That might work for now. Cheer up and start working, everyone. We have to make this place better before dark.
83400076=Boss! We need to Build the Road first before constructing anything. My Construction Vehicle won't run on the sand.
83400077=Despite reluctance, we've got to admit that all of our construction relies on Simon and his Construction Vehicle.
83400078=Therefore, we have to build a Main Road for the Construction Vehicle. All Buildings needed to be built near the Road.

83400104=Huh?
83400105=Let me work.

83401008=We must reinforce our base before the zombies arrive.
83401009=Place the Buildings at your preferred locations when planning your Territory. Also, long press the Buildings already constructed to adjust their locations again.

90450055=Of course, there's more help
90450056=Thank you again for your mercy, dear Commander.
90450057=Oh, my Fiona. Where are you on earth?
90450058=Fiona.
90460000=Claude Fehn
90460001=Character Background:
90460002=Claude and his fiancee Fiona both were part of the federation Army. Through years of experience combating the undead, only he can eliminate the most amount of zombies without losing much resources. \n Claude and Fiona were in love for quite a long time. He promised Fiona, They'll get married right after this mission. but the squad was broken apart by a swarm of zombies. and they were seperated.\n Just barely made it back alive, Claude had hoped to see his beloved once again, but she did not show. \n He did not sleep for 3 days, wishing to see her walking back to the barrack, and with the wish being shatter, he set on the journey to find her. \n though he knows the chances are slim, but he believes if she's alive, he WILL find her.
90460003=Recons from him:
90460004=The variation of Zombies has never stopped. As the level increases, the Combat Power has also increased by geometric factor. Kill different Zombies to provide us with various Resources. Pick the right moment to Kill Zombies with fine decision to relieve the stress of Resources. Increase the Number of Troops and research the Technologies to Kill Zombies to better take down the rotten flesh.
90460005=Hey, buddy! I've got a huge business here. Profit guaranteed. Let's make some money!
90460006=I'll find you, Fiona!
90460007=Nora
90460008=Pioneer: Nora
90460009=Merchant: Evan
90460010=Zombie Exterminator: Claude Fehn
90460011=I can't compete with Francis, that scholar psycho, in Research, but I'm way better than him in all other aspects!
90460012=All you need to do is follow orders, or I promise the next one to be bitten to death by Zombies is you~
90460013=When Nora was sent to the military school, she had no idea it'll be the last time she'll ever see her father. \n the second year of joining the federation, the Russian arms deal tycoon, was eliminated by the federation leaders. but anyone with half a brain will know, a large shipment of equipments, is just what these power hungry politicians need. \n there's never hiding the truth, when Nora found out the disapperance of her entire family. she set out to find the truth. and at the same time, her amazing talents will soon to be discovered by the army. even the mad scientist Francis consider her a healthy competition. \n From the fragments Nora recovered from ruins, Francis discovered that the people that attacked her family, is the very same federation they're working for. with the help of Francis, Nora got revenge, and went of the grid. \n with no where to go, she joined the Z-organization. and became a first officer at the dawn of the organization. but everyone knows, she is more than that.
90460014=After the Z Virus broke out, while the Apocalypse’s disaster was harvesting human’s lives, it was also inspiring humanity's potential. There was a slight probability that some Elites, who acquired extraordinary abilities, appeared among the Survivors. Destiny has been assembling these people. In order to save more humans, they formed the Human Revival Organization, code Z. \n Different from the Human Allied Force, most of the people here lived a life without any restrictions. Without a strict hierarchy or social class, sometimes with stone cold strength, there is no lack of human kindness. The Z Organization doesn't restrain its members. Even though some of its members cannot be seen as justice, what Z Organization guarantees is that when facing the threat of Zombies, all Fighters suspend everything to resist the ultimate enemy of entire humanity – Zombies. Everyone here has extraordinary experience, but they have the same persistence. They all possess the determined mind of eradicating the Zombies from the world!
90460015=Being avaricious of money but not fond of money is the real way to be rich.
90460016=It is without doubt that every newbie joining the Z Organization all doubt why the higher authorities allowed this guy to join the Organization. Evan, who must always mention money, would [treat] every newbie joining the Organization enthusiastically and condition them as his own customers. In the Z Organization, you may be unfamiliar with your own instructor, even the adjutant who has carried out the same operation with you, but you are unable to not recognize this fat Evan. \n However, in fact, the Z Organization will never recruit a mediocre person. Evan’s ability is to make the economy of the entire organization run methodically. He always knows the supply and demand of both sides, and will come up with win-win conditions which both sides cannot resist. He can always bring the competitiveness that others cannot catch up with. Depending on his powerful commercial ability, Evan provides over 60% of the entire organization's capital. \n When doing business, Evan is cunning. He will struggle for each percent of interest with his shrewd words and financial acuity, but Evan will never obey his principles: no fraud, no tricks. People jokingly call Evan a principled fatty. Just as Evan always says: Being avaricious of money but not fond of money is the real way to be rich.
90460017=In this time, keeping money inside your pocket will never produce more money. Having enough Resources is the only support for survival. Sending free Troops to Gather on the World Map isn’t a bad choice. Of course, this will cost some time. Running Resources in the Commercial Hub might be a good option. Send extra Resources to receive money, purchase urgently needed Resources to support construction. The Trading Helicopter will frequently visit our Shelter. Of course, if you need its arrival promptly, you can [Call] it in the Commercial Hub.
90460018=Francis
90460019=If there is anything that can save today's humanity, I reckon it must be science.
90460020=If there is anything that can destroy humanity, I reckon it must also be science.
90460021=Born in a family of aristocrats in dire straits, Francis revealed his extremely high IQ at the age of 12. His almost strong photographic memory and ability to calculate and analyze above his age surprised all his mentors. Without any difficulty, when Francis was 16 years old, he raised the Success Rate of Rapid Production of the Resource Equipment from 45% to 75%, and entered the supreme Institute of Allied Force with the joint recommendation from his mentors. Nevertheless, due to his young age, lack of social experience and the ability way surpassing his colleagues, Francis didn’t get along well with others there. This continued until the moment when he met domineering Nora, who was originally his opponent in the Allied Force Competition. \n [I’ll cover you kid from now on] said Nora arrogantly, when they first met. The introverted Francis didn’t admit, but first felt something more important other than his love of family and research. Therefore, when Nora came to him in tears, carrying stones eroded by biochemical arms, he decided to help whatever she wanted to complete without hesitation. \n After having helped Nora escape from the Camp, Francis’ life returned to the days when there was only research.
90460022=Technology can promise us to better survive in this Apocalypse. It can greatly increase the City’s Development and Troop Combat Power. The Human Allied Force are breaking through new Technology constantly to arm this state and their armies. \n Emm…...ah, wonder what Nora has been busy with these days.

I shoot a man, and I shootaman!-- Mohauuk\n     If Mohauuk ever asks you what's his strong suit, always answer he's smart, though everyone know he really isn't, but why would you ever argue with someone that has that much firepower to compensate for any of his short comings. Since anyone that ever dared to challenge his wit has perished, His seat at the table on the higher caste of the Gunna Boyz are un-movable as ever. Not to mention all his witty jokes.\n He's a shoota MAN because MAN stronger than Boyz.\nHe has a mohawk and he name Mohauuk because double U\n What? you no think funny? U die!
